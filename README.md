Default Parameters: its useful to have functions that some parameters are set to default in case we do not want to change it.

First-class vs higher-order functions
Firtst class functions: 
-JS treats functions as first-class functions
-Functions are simply treated as values
-Functions are just another "type" of object=>
since object are values, functions are values too-> Hence we can store them in variables or object properties. We can also pass function as arguments for another functions. 
There is also->return function from functions.
->call methods on functions (bind method)

Higheer-order function is either a function that receives anothe function as an argument or a function that returns a new function or both. This is possible because of first-class functions.

first class function is just a feature that a programming language has or not-> all functions are values.
